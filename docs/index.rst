   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.


.. warning::  This page will soon provide the user manual for the DeDop software. As you can see,
   it isn't even a skeleton yet, but we'll make it a useful place once we've released the first version
   of the DeDop processing software.
