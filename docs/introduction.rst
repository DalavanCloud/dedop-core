*A User Configurable Tool for Processing Delay Doppler Altimeter Data*


Delay Doppler Altimeter Data, and the |DeDop3| Project
======================================================

The recent development of SAR altimetry, or more properly Delay Doppler altimetry, as
implemented on CryoSat-2 and soon to be operated on Sentinel-3, opens an exciting new era for
the scientific community. This new approach offers to scientists an opportunity to develop new
processing schemes and derive new and improved products, and so maximise the benef
its of the measurements available from upcoming missions.
Historically, in conventional altimetry, the understanding of the Level 1b processor was the
responsibility of the instrument engineers with system expertise. This was logical as the
subsequent levels of processing only needed the results produced by the Level 1b processor
(Level 1b product) and the information contained in it. There were not many different correct ways
of processing the raw data up to Level 1b.

However, this approach is no longer appropriate for SAR Altimetry or Altimeter Delay Doppler
Processing. The links between the Level 1B processing and the Level 2 processing, particularly the
retracking of the waveforms, are very strong. For instance, different ways of performing the delay
Doppler processing lead to different L1B waveform shapes,and peculiarities of the Delay Doppler
Processor (DDP) have a noticeable effect on the L1B waveform leading to changes in the
geophysical retrievals.

Due to this strong link between the Level 1b process ing and the final geophysical retrievals, it is
important that the SAR Altimetry scientific community gains a much better understanding the Level
1B processor, and is involved in new developments. For various reasons (e.g. the novelty of the
processing, previous unavailability of adequate documentation, restricted availability of the low
levels of data), this understanding is currently limited, both in general terms of what a DDP is, and
in the different options chosen for the different missions.
The DeDop^3 project provides the scientific community with the means to understand and use low
level Altimetry data and to become involved in how these data are processed. This is achieved by
providing them with a Fully Adaptable and Configurable DDP and a friendly user interface (a tool)
to help them to interact with the DDP. The proposed DDP has different options from which the user
will be able to choose according to their particular field of interest. Examples of the new options
are: surface focusing (particularly relevant for special targets like coasts, rivers or lakes), any kind
of weighting along and across track, different azimuth processing approaches, stack masking, new
stacking algorithms (e.g. ACDC), Sigma-0 at stack level, etc.

The DDP is open source and the code will be freely available, in such a way that users will be able
to explore themselves the code and its possibilities and to modify it to their own needs.

The tool also comes with various demonstrations of new features that can be investigated and
retrieved when using these lower data processing levels. They are presented as successful case
studies.

Overview of |DeDop3| Tool
=========================

workbench provides a graphical user interface allowing for easy configuration and operation of the 
DDP shell. The workbenchâ€™s target users are community scientists wishing to learn, modify or
extend the DDP configuration and/or code and then use the tool for comparisons between various 
outputs generated by the DDP core. However, the workbench may also be used by operators who 
create configurations of the shell for e.g. bulk data processing in batch mode or for generating on-demand
processing requests.

   Software context: the processor and the workbench

The DDP workbench will be used to create and manage named DDP configurations, invoke the
DDP core processor with a given configuration and finally to read in the processor outputs for 
exploration and comparison with former outputs. It will have a clear, comprehensive, intuitive and 
accessible graphical user interface and comprise a flexible and extendible set of data visualisations
and analysis functions for the L1A, L1BS and L1B outputs. As stated before, the ultimate aim of the 
DDP user interface is to attract community scientists to use and modify the processing code and let
them become acquainted with the new Level-1 altimeter products.
